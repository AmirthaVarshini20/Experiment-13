# Aim: 
# Algorithm
Step 1: Write the python program for sum of digits of a number.
Step 2: Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested
should have assert keyword at the beginning.
Step 3: Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_sumofdig.py”.
Step 4: Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is
